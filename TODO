BUGS
=-=-
Emacs emulation inprovements:

 Rectangle mode for emacs yank system

 Overtype mode works for yank

 Query save loop? for kill-emacs and compile

 Emacs reload from file function? ^X ^V (it just works out if ^X ^V kills all
 instances of the buffer)

 Bufed should display unnamed buffers

 ESC args should work differently in emacs

 nextword,nextword,prevword sequence doesn't work for marking next successive
 word at ends of lines

 exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
 (it isn't in emacs either)

Allow either direct screen access or normal tty support for DOS version.
