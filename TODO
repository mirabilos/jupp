- shell window intercept should be smarter.  hit ^K ^H- the ^H is going to the
  shell window.

- do not use ^[^[ for anything.  it prevents Alt-arrow
  from being useful.

- search should automatically use 'k' mode if block is
  selected.  Cursor should jump to top of block when done.  Jump
  back to start mode?


- save all files without asking thing for quick compile

- better parsing of compile messages


- continued search mode for jpico?

- smarter highlighter- need char and string storage.

- make ^K F prompt with previous text (PICO)?

^K X leads to segfault?

if I use ^K C to move search string into search prompt, it says not found
even though it found it.

options are screwed up: we copy window to buffer (to get buffer options
to the buffer).  But if we have multiple windows, buffer options will have
stale data.

we are missing many query and prompt window abort handlers, which cause
small memory leaks.

- update help screens: some things have changed (emacs is more like emacs).


Fix for next release highlight:

  other windows why
  lose state during page down?
  perl highlighter
  more syntax files

  byte to byte conversions?
  UTF-8 decoder right at input instead of in qw and utype?

 Update man page.

 Reload modified files (or current window)

  don't use -notite by default. (why? we switched back to -notite…)

Watch loaded file for changes

Save all history buffers and keyboard macros in ~/.joe_state file?
Although, if merged, it must be disabled by default like mksh’s HISTFILE is:
  18:48⎜«asarch» That would be for a wish list then: to keep the
       ⎜    list of all opened files with their last position
  Natureshadow agrees with me that this is a JOE antifeature
   but then desires the file directory path history

  Update documentation.

shift/alt/ctrl arrow key stuff. (partially done)

regex: character classes? a-z matches any letter?

  parse *rc file only once?

  different symbol for 'joe' directory

  can't load terminfo- should switch to termcap or provide compiled
  ANSI terminfo built in.


New features:
-----------------------

  check all instances of 'chars': use UCS to locale symbols instead.
  EBCDIC ?
    - we assume '\n' is line terminator.
    - there are many references to '\t' and ' '.
    - EBCDIC used to be fixed record length (80 columns) anyway.

Math: octal(?), more functions. (-lm?)

Perl compatible regex search.
(Ugh. But grouping like \+\(foo\+ \) would be cool.)
(Also, alternatives and/or backreferences, think ^Q=)

Improvements for regular text
-----------------------------
mode where wordwrap wraps rest of paragraph?

mode where all editing wraps rest of paragraph?

soft wrap (i.e. wrap on screen but not in the file)!

Improvements for programming
----------------------------

Jump to definition (tags does this)

Show list of references

Diff mode (need vertical window)

Tie in with CVS

Refactoring

Syntax Highlighting:
--------------------

Support for more languages:

 Paragraph reformat mode for TeX files.

 ^G Matching for verilog begin ... end, html tags, etc.

 Reformat paragraph should reformat C function if we're editing C.

File loading/storing:

 Should have switch buffers in current window as more fundamental joe key
 sequence (it's ^[ u and ^[ v for now).

 Unnamed buffers should be in bufed list (was fixed in the lost joe 2.9)

Jmacs/Jstar/Jpico:

 search and replace 'fred' to 'foo':
    find 'Fred', gets 'Foo'.

 Rectangle mode for emacs yank system

 Overtype mode works for yank

 ESC args should work differently in emacs

 many negative args do not work properly

 exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
 (it isn't in emacs either)

Shell windows:

 Better environment settings for shell windows.

Documentation:

 Include documentation for joe hackers.  I wrote a lot of this
 some time, I need to find it.

 joe should open tty earlier in startup sequence because ^Y
 is suspend character on sun.

UTF-8/Internationalization
--------------------------

- right-left mode for Hebrew/Arabic?

  There is no good way to do this.  For all rtol, you could use a reversed
xterm.  For mixed, you need tags to indicate direction.


UI for changing colors in the editor (or at least dark/light mode)

More colors: UI for using 256 color xterms.


 Lock files being edited?
  one person gets write lock


 Don't understand:  optionally break hardlinks on save?  what is "tla"?

 Use memory mapped files to fast load large files.  Have to not
 count no. lines in each buffer on startup.


 Emulate other editors?  Brief, EDT?


Prompts:

 Sort should be column wise, not row wise?

 HTML-style thing for option selection?


Terminal handling:

 Emit ESC c to reset terminal on startup?
 -> no, this power-cycles a hardware DEC VT420 (takes 1-2 minutes)

 Look into clearing right-most column.

Macros:

 Interactive macros during file load are broken.  Think about multiple
 stack hack (otherwise template based C++ callbacks).


Mouse:

 ` and autoindent mode are a problem for drag and drop.
 any way we can distinguish normal typing from a drop?

 xterm can actually do that: it's called bracketed paste mode:
 you send ^[ [ ? 2 0 0 4 h then any pastes you receive begin
 with ^[ [ 2 0 0 ~ and end with ^[ [ 2 0 1 ~ until you send
 ^[ [ ? 2 0 0 4 l but it only works with recent xterm and, while
 you can wrap the requests between ^[ P and ^[ \ to make them
 pass GNU screen it would wreck havoc with the other tabs, so
 we make this conditional on $TERM being xterm-xfree86 offering
 a generic paste mode in addition via :paste keymap

 mouse mode: mouse can position cursor.  Would be good for
 jcua...

Major new modes:

 Fixed record length mode


Major code improvements:

 Vertical windows (optionally lock-stepped).


Major new features:

 Folding


Options

 Fix it so all options appear in ^T.  Maybe make hook function
 to handle major changes.  Need this for major mode change for
 hex edit mode.

Other requests:

 -show no. utf characters, not no. bytes
 (if so, both need to be available)


┌───────────┐
│ jupp TODO │
└───────────┘

• replace all int with size_t where applicable
• default utf8.c:locale_map to utf-8 when applicable (configure-time
  option perhaps? Android definitely, Cygwin definitely not…)
• merge syntax handling code from joe-3.7+
• merge math from joe-3.7+
• make -Wcast-qual clean
• write a jupp(1) mdoc page
• use mirkev (better code for hashtables)
• attach labels to ftypes; allow ftypes to inherit from these
  labels, instead of fdefault; add UI to apply an ftype, including
  fdefault, to the current buffer (requested by Wayne Cuddy)
• regex needs groups like 「\+\(foo\)」
• regex needs alternative modes (POSIX BRE, ERE; PCRE optional?)
  because of the \0 vs. \1 confusion (and WTF @ \N letters!)
• ^KE could offer the last directory from a file that was saved
  with a / somewhere (file_prompt in joe 4.4 wmkpw)
• bracketed paste mode should disable autoindent, wordwrap,
  updating the status line, …(?) ⇐ implemented using a “paste”
  labeled ftype (including using not the help cards for indication)
• switch from autoconf to mirtoconf2
• ANSI syntax highlighting; auto-turn it on in shell windows (‽)
  ⇒ would need to hide the ANSI chars, yet enable backspacing
• redraw a line if it has been scrolled and had combining
  characters in it before — actually, scrap that; make that:
  handle combining characters, *at all* (in the scrn array)
• add a soft line break flag: display as line-wrapped, do not
  save any newlines introduced by that
• perhaps wrap at U+00AD?
• have an mdoc(7) page actually describing its keybindings
• put all “configuration” into /usr/share/ and have them
  (all, not just *rc) overridable from the user’s home; use XDG dirs
  while at it maybe? and replace autoconf with mirtoconf, and use
  serial numbers for versions (jupp-26 follows joe-3.1jupp25)
• do charset conversion and support more charsets, both SBCS and
  UCS (UTF-{16,32}{BE,LE} for example) sponsored by ⮡ tarent
• plug memory leaks (Valgrind reports a few)
• fix Coverity-pointed-out issues
• fixup some joe4.4 jupprc ftypes
• …
