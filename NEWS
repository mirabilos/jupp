  undisplayable (control) characters and incomplete multibyte
  sequences; fix displaying these at end of line

  terminal, even from !UTF-8 documents
- Add built-in (minimal) jupprc file, for standalone EXEs

  * JUPP for Unix (joe 3.1 with all jupp patches and a diverging,
    more featureful jupprc than joe 3.1jupp10 had)

  guess_indent, purify, smartbacks; some are disabled by default
  though (autoindent, smarthome, smarthome+indentfirst)

JOE 3.1jupp8

- Bugfix (maybe) for backspace deleting more than it should
  when smart backspaces or auto-indent are off
- In UTF-8 mode, display illegal characters as reversed (inverse)
  underlined U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, one per octet (if these
  form a valid part of an invalid multibyte sequence, the first
  valid octets are not necessarily individually selectable)
- In UTF-8 mode, don't display the decimal ASCII value of a wide
  character; display the correct UCS-2 hex value (or <-2> for an
  invalid sequence or the 8-bit hex value of the octet for an
  invalid octet or invalid one-octet multibyte sequence) instead
- Upgrade to latest MirOS licence template

JOE 3.1jupp7

- Bugfix in bundled strlcat() implementation
- Bugfix (off-by-one array bounds) in from_uni()
- New option "vispace" to make spaces and tabs visible, like in
  Microsoft® Works®. Works best with Unicode.

  "keepup" have been moved to the top so they can be switched
  quickly if you're in an ssh situation
- Disable funny behaviour of keys in menus, fixes POLS
- Reduce memory usage a little
- In the options menu, if "return" is hit instead of entering a value,
  and it is not a string, it's handled sensitively: numbers keep their
  value, syntax gets unset, and encoding gets reset to the fdefault map.
- Nicely format the options menu (as columns); print values for the
  syntax and encoding options as well in the oversight, use ellipsis for
  strings which aren't displayed otherwise
- Spelling fixes in the options menu
- Honour internationalisation framework of MirOS #9-current and newer
