** JOE 2.6

- Fixed stupid bug in termcap.c which prevented terminfo from working

- ESC h was missing from jpicorc

- Changes suggested by Dan Nelson:
 - backup files now attempt to have same permissions and times as original
 - Stat command now ands chars with 255 (don't know why this worked on my system
   without this...)
 - Maybe change shell invocation name- have to check this more

** JOE 2.5

- No longer use ^[ O, ^[ A, ^[ B, ^[ C, or ^[ D for anything because they
  interfere with arrow keys.

- Couldn't create new files because of bug in readonly setting

- fwrdc/bkwdc were crashing the editor except when called from wordstar

- 'tr' command was not called in a portable way in jmacs

- 'tr' was causing problems with the spell-check macros as well

- filter region was not working: had to add 'query' in ^[ | macro

- Changed incremental search so that whatever key the command is bound to
  can be used to repeat the search (used to only be able to use ^S)

** JOE 2.4

- Closing message was incorrect when exit macros (macros where the last
  command is abortbuf) were used.

- SuperPico rc file added

- Write block now writes the entire file if no block is set

- Added pico kill function for pico emulation
  (tried to do this with 'psh,markk,blkdel' where blkdel deletes lines if
   no block is set, but it didn't group the deletes right in the yank
   buffer)

- Filter block would leave the marks set

- Fixed ^@ in joe mode

- Fixed help screen glitches in wordstar mode

- If joe can't make a backup file it now prompts for you to save anyway

- Eliminated IDLEOUT compile option.  Now is the user gives - on the
  command line, joe uses /dev/tty.

- Added %o %O %a %A %X and %R status line messages

- Starts out in read only mode if loaded file can not be written to

- If joe can't find the termcap/terminfo entry, it instead uses the default

- termcap routines are now included even if you use terminfo.  If your
  terminal can't be found in the terminfo database, it will look in
  the termcap database too.

- The JOETERM environment variable can be used to bypass the TERM
  environment variable setting.

- Search & Replace bugs fixed
   - replace would mess up the end mark of a marked block
   - a search would trash ^KB if only ^KB was set
